Hard Boiled|Boiled eggs are eggs (typically chicken eggs) cooked with their shells unbroken, usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify.
Scrambled|Scrambled eggs is a dish made from whites and yolks of eggs stirred, beaten, and cooked together typically with milk and butter and variable other ingredients.
Fried egg|A fried egg is a cooked dish commonly made using a fresh hen's egg, fried whole with minimal accompaniment. Fried eggs are traditionally eaten for breakfast in English-speaking countries but may also be served at other times of the day. 
Poached|A poached egg is an egg that has been cooked by poaching, that is, in simmering liquid. This method of preparation is favored because a very consistent and predictable result can be obtained with precise timing, as the boiling point of water removes the temperature variability from the cooking process (except for the need to adjust for altitude, given that the boiling point of water decreases as altitude increases).
